Current TODO List:


- move weight logic out of Playfield.land_ball(). The weight logic is (at least) also needed when a Scoring finishes. There should be a Playfield.ensure_weight_correctness() that calculates all weights, calls lower_column()/raise_column(), throws Balls if needed etc. It should return True if something starts moving, else False. Use that return-value to decide whether to check for Scoring or delay that until Seesaw_Tilting is finished. Maybe ensure_weight_correctness() is not the best name for that.
- move the EventQueue to global scope (or local variable of module Ongoing?). There will always be only one EventQueue, no need to have it as a parameter for a billion functions
- maybe sort content of Constants into timings and pixel-counting stuff? Make it two (or more) separate objects?
- a finished Scoring or Seesaw_Tilting should trigger a (playfield-wide) check for Scoring. In case of finished Scoring, check for weight-correctness first.
- throw_ball(), Ongoing.Thrown_Ball. Skip the conversions if the Ball is thrown off the playfield for now.
- global variables total_Score, total_dropped_Balls, level
- increase level every 50 balls, level is maxweight and number of possible colors for new random-generated Balls
- like Scoring, there is Combining: A stack of five balls of the same color will Combine to a single ball with the same total weight.

Recent changes:
- Combined all the weight logic into Playfield.gravity_moves(). It does a full scan for wrong-aligned seesaws, (TODO starts SeesawTilting), pushes columns to the correct positions and (TODO throws balls if needed).

Current untested stuff:




maybe later TODOs:

- (placeholder) graphics for Seesaw_Tilting. And for Thrown_Ball once it exists
- more Special_Balls
- Thrown_Ball logic for balls thrown out of the playfield

Ideas (Special Balls):
- The Pickup: Puts the ball where it lands into the Crane, discarding the one that's there.
- Time-delayed Bomb: Shows a countdown, explodes at zero.
- Color Time-delayed Bomb: Turns all balls of the color it hits into time-delayed Bombs, with random timers.
- The big Stabilizer: The lowest Colored_Ball on each low-side of a seesaw has its weight multiplied by 10.
- The big Destabilizer: All Colored_Balls have their weight set to zero, except one (randomly chosen) per column.

Ideas (others):
- unique permanent bonuses for 3 stars and 3 gold-stars. Like slower movement, global score factor, throw preview, higher rate of Special Balls
- VS mode. Throw balls to opponent, give them special negative effects (inverted Crane movement, auto-drop every few seconds, weight-changes, ...)
