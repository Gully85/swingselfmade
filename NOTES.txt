Current TODO List:

- move object.changed logic into the class. Call draw() every frame, but dont do anything if 
    nothing changed
- test around Abstract Base Classes. What happens if they dont have their values/methods?
- maybe sort content of Constants into timings and pixel-counting stuff? 
    Make it two (or more) separate objects? Local dictionary of the Constants module?
- placeholder graphics for moving seesaw
- placeholder graphics for Combining
- Special Balls. Start with Bomb or Cutter, that should be the easiest ones.
- Ball generation, preview for upcoming Specials
- "Logbook mode", write events to a log-file. Helpful if we let others look for bugs. 
    Have a tmp logfile, if a certain key is pressed, move it to a permanent file. Regular 
    updates (at each level?) for the full game state. Track all Ongoing_Events in there. 
    While at it, remove unneccessary console output.
- expand Colorscheme to more than 10 Ball colors. Can just use 5 different shapes (ellipse, 
    rectangle, circle, ?), thats enough for 50 levels. The original SWING had 54 levels, beyond 
    that no new colors were coming.
- after Scoring, show the score added for a few frames. Can use an Ongoing Event for this.
- draw seesaws in a way that shows which ones are connected
- re-do ThrowingBall trajctory. If landing in-field, can just use the ascending half of a parabola
- change Combining to be able to combine 6+ balls



Recent changes:
- moved Ball dropping logic to Playfield.refresh_status() and Playfield.check_hanging_balls()
- Added Combining of vertical Fives into one ball with the same total weight. The check for 
    this is in Playfield.refresh_status() in the correct priority.

Suspected possible bugs:
- perhaps range is off by one if flying out to the left for at least twice (range 10 or greater)


Known bugs, need to find exact conditions to reproduce
- A Scoring can remove a Blocked if a seesaw tilts while the Scoring expands. 
- Scoring seems to remove wrong-colored Balls sometimes



maybe later TODOs:
- more Special_Balls
- it is atm not consistent if we need playfield to be a parameter in the Ongoings. For later VS mode,
     we need to handle two Playfields at once, but with a shared eventQueue.
- automate creation of standalone-exe. For now, use the console command 
pyinstaller --onefile SelfSwing_main.py

Special Balls in the original SWING:
- Joker: Counts as any color for the purpose of Scoring. Can start two Scorings at once, 
    e.g. in a configuration like x x (Joker) y y. Will not start a Combining (vertical five).
- Bomb: When landing on a Ball, destroy all Balls in a 3x3 environment. When landing on an 
    empty seesaw, do nothing. A Bomb lying aroung will explode once something lands on it, 
    even if it lies under other Balls. A Bomb thrown out sideways will become a Heart. Any
    other Special Ball  (except negative Specials in VS mode) thrown out sideways will become a Bomb.
- Cutter: Destroy the stack it lands on
- Zap: Destroy all Balls of the color it lands on
- Tint: Re-color all Balls (even Specials) of the stack into the color it lands on. Can multiply 
    Special Balls except Stars and Bombs.
- Flash: Re-color randomly in a triangle below it into the color it lands on. On average, two re-colors per row.
- Color Joker: All Balls of the color it lands on are transformed to Jokers.
- Diagonal Cutter: Destroy all Balls diagonal from its landing spot.
- Zap Top: Destroy the top Ball of each stack, except if landing on an empty seesaw.
- Tint Depot: Bottom row of the Depot is re-colored to the color it lands on.
- Flash Diagonal: All Ball diagonal from its landing spot are re-colored to the color it lands on.
- Color Bomb: Transforms all Balls of the color it lands on into Bombs.
- Zap Horizontal: Destroys the row of its landing spot.
- Multicolor Zap: Destroys all colors that exist in the stack it lands on.
- Tint 3x3: Re-colors a 3x3 environment into the color it lands on.
- Flash Triangle: Re-Color the full triangle below it into the color it lands on. 

- Niveller: All Balls in the stack it lands on have their weight set to zero.
- Stonemaker: All Balls in a 3x3 environment around its landing spot are transformed into Stones.
- Shadowmaker: Makes a shadow in a 3x3 environment around its position. Balls under the shadow are not 
    drawn, but still work normally.
- Sting: From time to time, destroy the Ball below and on top of this. Random, becomes slower over time.
- Color Stonemaker: All Balls of the color it lands on are transformed into Stones.
- Shadow Clock: Make a shadow over the full Playfield for a while. If thrown, the shadow duration is 
    proportional to throwing range. 
- Tower: Stack Stones where it lands, until the highest allowed position.
- Tornado: Suck all Balls from its stack and randomly throw them left and right

- Questionmark: Becomes a random Special Ball in the Crane.
- Silver Star: Spawns at every levelup in the Depot, can not be created by any Tint/Flash re-coloring. 
    A horizontal Three of Silver Stars will Score everything in the Playfield.
- Golden Star: Two stacked Silver Stars become a Gold Star. Can not be created by any Tint/Flash re-coloring. 
    A horizontal Three of Gold Stars will Score everything in the Playfield, and add the previous total score, 
    then multiply by the current Level, then add that number to the score.
- Heart: Three Hearts can score a Three (with zero points).
- Stone: No interactions/effects. Can not score a Three or Combine a vertical Five.

Ideas (Special Balls):
- The Pickup: Puts the ball where it lands into the Crane, discarding the one that's there.
- Time-delayed Bomb: Shows a countdown, explodes at zero.
- Color Time-delayed Bomb: Turns all balls of the color it hits into time-delayed Bombs, with random timers.
- The big Stabilizer: The lowest Colored_Ball on each low-side of a seesaw has its weight multiplied by 10.
- The big Destabilizer: All Colored_Balls have their weight set to zero, except the top one per column.

Ideas (others):
- ThrownBalls could have an actual trajectory like a thrown ball. It ends in the top place of the correct row
    and then becomes a FallingBall.
- unique permanent bonuses for 3 stars and 3 gold-stars. Like slower movement, global score factor, 
    throw preview, higher rate of Special Balls
- VS mode. Throw balls to opponent, give them special negative effects (inverted Crane movement, 
    auto-drop every few seconds, weight-changes, ...)
- auto-drop could be generally a good challenge.
