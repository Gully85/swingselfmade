Current TODO List:

- Playfield.raise_column() and Playfield.lower_column() are better names, shorter and more general. Parameters just x and dy, dy can be only 1 or 2. Maybe even combine these into one function.
- move weight logic out of Playfield.land_ball(). The weight logic is (at least) also needed when a Scoring finishes. There should be a Playfield.ensure_weight_correctness() that calculates all weights, calls lower_column()/raise_column(), throws Balls if needed etc. It should return True if something starts moving, else False. Use that return-value to decide whether to check for Scoring or delay that until Seesaw_Tilting is finished. Maybe ensure_weight_correctness() is not the best name for that.
- move the EventQueue to global scope (or local variable of module Ongoing?). There will always be only one EventQueue, no need to have it as a parameter for a billion functions
- maybe sort content of Constants into timings and pixel-counting stuff? Make it two (or more) separate objects?
- a finished Scoring or Seesaw_Tilting should trigger a (playfield-wide) check for Scoring. In case of finished Scoring, check for weight-correctness first.
- throw_ball(), Ongoing.Thrown_Ball. Skip the conversions if the Ball is thrown farther than the Playfields for now.
- global variables total_Score, total_dropped_Balls, level
- increase level every 50 balls, level is maxweight and number of possible colors for new random-generated Balls

Current untested stuff:




maybe later TODOs:

- (placeholder) graphics for Seesaw_Tilting. And for Thrown_Ball once it exists
- more Special_Balls
- Thrown_Ball logic for balls thrown out of the playfield
